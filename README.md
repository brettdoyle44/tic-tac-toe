A game by Brett Doyle

## Intro

Welcome to my tic tac toe project! This is my first ever project built using APIs and writing the javascript/jQuery logic from scratch. My goal will be to refactor to make the code DRYer and introduce some more Bootstrap to make the board and elements look better.

## List of Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* jQuery
* Bootstrap

## Planning

My plan was to build the board first and then start on the API, then deal with the game locally, which I mostly accomplished. After getting the Auth and Game APIs working I started on the Game Logic and that took the most significant amount of time.

## Development Process

After creating the board, setting up the Authentication piece second helped me get more comfortable calling the API via curl scripts. This assisted in making sure I was calling the Games API correctly. Once those pieces were in place I started to fill out the game logic, starting with what I thought was the easiest to accomplish and build off of. Honestly, the process was all about keeping my confidence high. I felt if I could get small wins they would help me get through the bigger tasks that I was not comfortable with. For the most part that worked.
